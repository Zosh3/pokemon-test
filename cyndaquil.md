Cyndaquil is the fire type starter for the Johto region, debuting in Generation 2. Cyndaquil is also the starter in Legends: Arceus and its final evolution, Typhlosion, has a fire/ghost regional form available in the game.  

 Cyndaquil is a timid Pokémon. When startled, Cyndaquil will curl up in a ball and the flames on its back will flare up vigorously.  

Cyndaquil is based on an echidna, an egg-laying mammal from Australia. The closed eyes and lit flames resemble a porcupine. Cyndaquil could also be based on the Hinezumi, a fire mouse that lives in volcanos in Chinese mythology.  

Cyndaquil’s name is derived from “cinder” (a small piece of burnt wood/coal) and “quill” (sharp spines found on a mammal such as a hedgehog).
